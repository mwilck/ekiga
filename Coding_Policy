Developers :
- Please keep the current coding style in GnomeMeeting and put comments.
Functions descriptions should have 3 fields. DESCRIPTION, BEHAVIOR and PRE.
PRE means the set of conditions on the parameters to be sure that the 
function works.
- About gconf: All notifiers and all gconf_client_notify_add must be in
confing.cpp. The callback that updates the gconf cache must be located
in the file containing the widget associated to the callback. Some general
callbacks for toggles, entries, option menus are located in gconf.cpp.
- Options: GnomeMeeting follows the "Instant Apply" model.
- The way to include things is the following: include the GnomeMeeting headers before the others. All the .h files should contain #include "common.h" as first include because it will itself include a ptlib file containing compilation flags required to have a well-working GnomeMeeting. The .h corresponding to the .cpp file must be included before the other includes. Libraries headers includes must follow the application headers includes. ../config.h must be included before the rest in all .cpp files.
