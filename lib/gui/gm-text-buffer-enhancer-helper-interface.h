/* This method is used to have all enhancers tell what they think they can do
 * to enhance a text ; then the enhancer will choose the most suitable helper
 * and use the next method.
 * For this reason, the helper receives :
 * - the full text (full_text parameter) ;
 * - where in the full text it should start looking for interesting things (from
 *   parameter) ;
 * and it returns two values (the start and length out parameters) :
 * - where it thinks it can do something (the start parameter) ;
 * - on which length it will do it (the length parameter).
 *
 * The idea is :
 * - return a zero length if nothing interesting can be done (start will then
 *   be ignored by the caller) ;
 * - the length allows the enhancer to prefer the helper which saw "fooz" when
 *   compared to the one which saw "foo".

/* This method is called by the enhancer when the helper has been choosen

 * - the iterator (iter parameter) where to insert the enhanced text ;
 * - the active tags (tags parameter), which is an in&out parameter, hence
 *   the enhancer can change them and use them ;
 * - the full text which the enhancer is trying to insert ;
 * - where in the text the helper said it would work (the start parameter),
 *   as in&out parameter so the helper can swallow it ;
 * - the length (length parameter) of the part the helper said was interested
 *   in.
 *
 * "the helper said" means those values are those the helper answered in its
