   * We will have one GActorMenu per UI object displaying an Actor.

   * specific to the Actor. They can be triggered, for example, by the
   * various GActorMenu associated with the different views of the
   * Actor.
   *
   * The GActorMenu is the binding between GIO Actions and Ekiga::Actions.
   *
   * When a GActorMenu is created from an Actor, all available Actions are
   * automatically registered through the GIO subsystem. Actions are
   * unregistered from the GIO subsystem when the GActorMenu is destroyed.
   *
   * You should not have several GActorMenu with conflicting Actions alive
   * at the same time (e.g. several GActorMenu associated to different contacts
   * each exposing a call action).
