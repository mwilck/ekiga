  /** Generic implementation for the Ekiga::Source abstract class.
   *
   * This class is there to make it easy to implement a new type of
   * addressbook source: it will take care of implementing the external api,
   * you just have to decide when to add and remove books.
   *
   * It also provides basic memory management for books, with the second
   * (optional) template argument:
   *  - either no management (the default) ;
   *  - or the book is considered bound to one Ekiga::Source, which will
   *    trigger its destruction (using delete) when removed from it.
   *
   * You can remove a Book from an Ekiga::Source in two ways:
   *  - either by calling the remove_book method,
   *  - or by emission of the book's removed signal.
   *
   * Notice that this class won't take care of removing the book from a
   * backend -- only from the Ekiga::Source.
   * If you want the Book <b>deleted</b> from the real backend, then you
   * probably should have an organization like :
   *  - the book has a 'deleted' signal;
   *  - the source listens for this signal;
   *  - when the signal is received, then do a remove_book followed by calling
   *    the appropriate api function to delete the Book in your backend.
