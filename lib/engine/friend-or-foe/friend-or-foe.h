/* IFF stands for "Identification Friend or Foe" and is a military system
 * used to determine if an aircraft is a friend or a foe.
 *
 * In ekiga, there's no aircraft in sight, and the question isn't that of
 * shooting or not : the problem is to determine if an incoming call should
 * be rejected, accepted... or if we ring to let the user decide.
 *
 * Since we want several pieces of code to be able to provide information,
 * we add in a helper class, which the main Ekiga::FriendOrFoe object uses
 * to determines its answer. And since we want to be extensible, the question
 * depends on a domain : "call", "message", etc.
 *
 * The code which gets a determination by Ekiga::FriendOrFoe can of course do
 * whatever it wants with the answer!
