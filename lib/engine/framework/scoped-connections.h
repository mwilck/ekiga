/* The boost signals2 library has several tricks to disconnect connections on signals
 * automatically, namely :
 * - inherit from boost::signals2::trackable, which is good to get rid of
 * connnections to a dying object (but that basically means you are lazy
 * so it's probably better to avoid that method, as that means we might
 * end up with memory problems later on) ;
 * - use a boost::signals2::scoped_connection which makes it possible to do things
 * more manually, but is annoying when you need many of them because they're not
 * easy to put in a container ;
 *
 * This file provides a scoped_connections class, in which you can put your
 * connections, and which will disconnect them either when it dies or if you
 * asked it to clear. That makes it possible to listen to signals on an object,
 * then clear, then listen to signals on another object. Or it just makes it easy
 * to manage a big number of connections.
